Comments on google-services.json:

The google-services.json file is configured for Firebase connection.
Do not modify this file directly to avoid issues with the Firebase connection.


Folder structure for the project:

    activities: In this folder, I will manage the main activities of the computer components
sales application, such as ProductListActivity, where the product list will be displayed, and ProductDetailActivity to view the details of each product.

    database: Although my application will use Firebase as the main backend, this folder
can be useful if later I decide to add some type of local storage (e.g., cache or data persistence with SQLite).

    models: Here I will define the models or entities that I will use in my application,
such as Producto.kt, Categoria.kt, etc. These classes will represent the data in my domain.

    repositories: I will implement the repositories here to manage the interaction with Firebase.
The repositories will be responsible for retrieving products, handling purchases, and any other interaction with the backend or data sources.

    ui.theme: In this folder, I will handle the interface customization, such as themes or styles
for the application, ensuring that the visual experience is consistent across all screens.

    utils: This folder will contain utility functions or helper classes that I can reuse
in various parts of the application, such as validations, data conversions, or any other auxiliary logic.

    viewmodels: In this folder, I will organize the ViewModels that will manage the logic
for each screen or section. For example, a ProductViewModel to manage the logic for the product list and its interaction with the repositories.

    fragments: I will add a folder named fragments to store the application's fragments,
as the activities will mainly serve as containers for fragments. This will allow me to better organize the user interface.

    network: If at some point I decide to integrate external APIs,
I will create a folder network to manage network requests and keep this logic separate from other layers of the application.

    This structure will allow me to follow a clear and organized approach
to develop my computer components sales application, keeping the logic well-separated and easily scalable.
